## Project Title:
Approaches to Information Retrieval Using Legal Text Documents.
## Description:
When lawyers in our country receive a new case, they compare it to the prior one. To solve a new case, he must conduct numerous case studies. There are also many situations, and finding a new caustic match with the prior ones is extremely tough.

Using information retrieval systems, the previous case that is relevant to the present case may be identified very easily in this project.

## Dataset:
I utilized two different datasets. The first are "previous cases," which I used to train the model, and the second are "current cases," which I used to detect similarities with the prior cases.

## Model:
Word2vec, Fasttext, the BERT pre-trained model (bert-base-nli-mean-tokens), and the DistilBERT pre-trained model(distilbert-base-nli-mean-tokens) were all employed.

## Result:
The ultimate result displays the top five most similar former cases to each present case.
